  description: "Officials from Hong Kong flew to Montana last week for an under-the-radar
    meeting with U.S. lawmakers about ongoing pro-democracy protests and congressional
    legislation to protect freedom in Hong Kong, according to sources familiar with
    the meeting. \r\n\r\nThe Hong Kong delegation included officials who approve of
    the government\u2019s controversial extradition bill that originally kickstarted
    the mass protests as well as those who support the pro-democracy movement. The
    bill, put forward by Hong Kong, would allow China to detain and extradite people
    who are wanted in territories Hong Kong does not have extradition agreements with,
    including mainland China. \n\n\nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/hong-kong-officials-met-with-us-lawmakers-about-punishing-china?fbclid=IwAR3isBBppsN2P6n6sQpil4R4bD0m-JUeRtShYuAu_XTK5TvojtOOTrexTbQ"
