  description: 'Violence erupted this weekend around a besieged Hong Kong university,
    as protesters threw petrol bombs and fired arrows at police in an attempt to keep
    control of the campus. Hong Kong police appealed to protesters early Monday, local
    time, to leave the scene of an intense stand-off and threatened to respond with
    live bullets if protesters continue to use what they called "lethal weapons."
    The warning came as a fiery clash between protesters and police outside the Hong
    Kong Polytechnic University entered its second night. Protesters have been hurling
    gasoline bombs while police have answered with tear gas and water cannons.
