  description: 'Transcript of press conference


    Reporter: As what Mr Lee just said, we need to investigate the whole thing ...
    So why don''t you initiate this commission and how do you see the IPCC (Independent
    Police Complaints Council) are able to do this? ...


    Secretary for Security: Thank you for your questions and I will answer my part
    first and I will pass on. First of all, we have this statutory body which is IPCC,
    which has been doing complaints against Police in accordance with its legal set
    up and its legal power... The second thing is the IPCC has already indicated that
    they will do something which is special in examining all the possible evidence
    in this case, which is not something they will usually do, which indicates their
    seriousness in handling this matter...
