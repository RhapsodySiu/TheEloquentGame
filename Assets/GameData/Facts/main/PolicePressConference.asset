  description: 'Transcript of press conference


    Reporter: As what Mr Lee just said, we need to investigate the whole thing and
    many requesting independent commission of inquiry that is not just investigating
    the Police but also the government officials and the whole situation including
    the protesters. So why don''t you initiate this commission and how do you see
    the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Council) are able to do this? And won''t
    it be too late for the IPCC to start investigating Police after they have done
    all those bloody actions, because people are already getting hurt?


    Secretary for Security: Thank you for your questions and I will answer my part
    first and I will pass on. First of all, we have this statutory body which is Independent
    Police Complaints Council, which has been doing complaints against Police in accordance
    with its legal set up and its legal power. The IPCC has been dealing with complaints
    of this nature since its establishment. And there have been occasions where actually
    cases will be brought to the court. So I believe in its effectiveness. The second
    thing is the IPCC has already indicated that they will do something which is special
    in examining all the possible evidence in this case, which is not something they
    will usually do, which indicates their seriousness in handling this matter. As
    far as I have understood from the IPCC through public release, they actually will
    be inviting evidence from all sources and this is something that they are doing
    specially for this case. From all sources, that means even if the source is unproven,
    they will still examine it. And it is going to be a thorough and impartial investigation
    by the complaint system, which will be monitored by the IPCC. And we have this
    system which is established under the law. The IPCC has indicated that they will
    also make their study, a report to be submitted to the Chief Executive who has
    asked for the report to be made public. And it will be only after a thorough investigation
    is completed, then we will see the full picture.
