  description: "The Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies at the Chinese University
    of Hong Kong polled 743 people aged 18 and above by telephone at the end of October
    to gauge their views on new immigrants. \u201CThe negative attitudes of local
    Hongkongers towards new immigrants from the mainland China largely came from worries
    about the negative consequences on social and economic resources, but less from
    discrimination originated from their identity,\u201D the institute said in the
    report.\n\nhttps://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/2045204/hong-kong-media-vilification-mainland-chinese"
