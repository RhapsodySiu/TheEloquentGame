  description: "Ten straight weeks of anti-government protests in Hong Kong are taking
    a sharp toll on an economy already hit by the U.S.-China trade war. The protests
    began as weekend marches, but have become a daily phenomenon. As police tear gas
    has been countered by demonstrator petrol bombs, retail and tourism are taking
    a hit. Global brands from Walt Disney to Prada have warned of the impact. Cathay
    Pacific Airways and other airlines have canceled hundreds of flights after a sudden
    airport shutdown this week.\r\n\r\nMore than $600 billion of stock market value
    has been erased since early July, and analysts are expressing concern that property
    values could slump. Gross domestic product expanded just 0.6% in the second quarter
    and the continued unrest could raise the possibility of a recession, according
    to Bloomberg Economics.\n\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-hong-kong-protests-economic-impact/"
