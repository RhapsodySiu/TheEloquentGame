  description: 'Hong Kong International Airport lost close to 1 million passengers
    in November, the steepest numerical drop in any single month since violent anti-government
    protests began in the city, official figures released on Sunday showed. In the
    worst drop in more than a decade, the airport handled 5.02 million passengers,
    some 969,000 fewer in November, a drop of 16.2 per cent compared to the same period
    in 2018.
