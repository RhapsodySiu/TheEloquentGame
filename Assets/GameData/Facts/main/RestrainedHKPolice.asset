  description: "From Spain to the UK and from Chile to Bolivia, protests have rocked
    the streets. Some of these countries include those considered democratic countries
    or development models for their regions. \r\n\r\nDespite the different reasons
    for the protests in these countries, the police and relevant departments hold
    the same firm attitude on dealing with protests. Compared to them, Hong Kong police,
    who have experienced serious threats for the past weeks, are restrained and cautious.
    Some netizens called the Hong Kong police the most restrained force in the world.
    \"Protesters want the police to attack them, to advance their ridiculous Hong
    Kong police brutality narrative,\" a Twitter user wrote. \r\n\nhttp://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1168214.shtml\n"
