  description: "China\u2019s top diplomat in Hong Kong has launched a scathing attack
    on the city\u2019s protest movement, labelling it as an independence campaign
    to overthrow the government, and appealing to the international community to speak
    out against the \u201Cvirus of street violence\u201D spreading overseas.\r\n\u201CRecent
    days have seen the street violence in Hong Kong imitated in other cities and countries
    around the globe, and the activists championing so-called \u2018Hong Kong independence\u2019
    colluding with foreign separatists at a faster pace,\u201D Xie Feng, commissioner
    of China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs office in the city, warned at a forum
    on Beijing\u2019s Greater Bay Area project on Thursday.\r\nHe hit out at anti-government
    protesters and the \u201Cblack hands\u201D behind them, calling their opposition
    to the now-withdrawn extradition bill merely a pretext for insurrection.\n\nhttps://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3034365/hong-kong-protests-virus-violence-deadlier-sars-and\n"
