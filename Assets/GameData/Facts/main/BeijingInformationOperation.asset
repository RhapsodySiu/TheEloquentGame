  description: "New research by the Journalism and Media Studies Centre of the Hong
    Kong University unveiled that disinformation spread on social media by China framed
    the 2019 Hong Kong protests as a separatist movement.\r\n\r\nSince August 2019,
    China\u2019s information operations on Hong Kong protests have been unveiled internationally.
    This was brought to light after a number of social media platforms, including
    Twitter and Facebook, discovered the existence of coordinated network activities
    by China that were spreading disinformation about Hong Kong protests. Twitter
    said that the aim of these operations was to undermine the protest movement\u2019s
    \u201Clegitimacy and political positions.\u201D\n\nhttps://hongkongfp.com/2019/11/05/beijing-constructs-independence-plot-hong-kong-protests-information-operations/"
