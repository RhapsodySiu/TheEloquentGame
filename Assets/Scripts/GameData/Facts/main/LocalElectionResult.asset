  description: "Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy candidates won big in local elections
    on Sunday, but there will be no easy solutions to the issues hanging over the
    territory as protesters stand up to China\u2019s growing influence, analysts told
    CNBC on Monday.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s very clear that people are not happy with
    the government, so they try to support the pro-democracy camp in this election,\u201D
    said Alfred Wu, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy
    in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe polls come after six months of anti-government, pro-democracy
    protests that have turned increasingly violent, and as Hong Kong struggles to
    overcome its most serious political crisis in decades. The local elections have
    been widely viewed as a barometer of public sentiment.\n\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/25/hong-kong-protests-landslide-win-for-pro-democracy-parties-in-elections.html"
