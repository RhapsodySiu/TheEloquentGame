  description: "In a part of the world familiar with conflict, dislocation and ruthless
    ideological extremism, Hong Kong has long beckoned as an oasis of stability.\n\nIt
    has served as a bridge between two rival powers nursing mutual suspicions, the
    United States and China. It is Chinese territory yet governed by a legal system
    inherited from the West, and intertwined with the global financial system.\n\nBut
    now Hong Kong\u2019s status as neutral ground between mainland China and the outside
    world is being threatened by a pair of momentous confrontations. As President
    Trump increases tariffs on Chinese goods in his trade war, the value of Hong Kong
    as a hub for commerce is being diminished. And as protesters filling  Hong Kong\u2019s
    streets accuse China of breaching a deal that was supposed to protect the territory\u2019s
    democratic norms, the endurance of its semiautonomous status appears in doubt.\n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/29/business/hong-kong-china-power.html"
