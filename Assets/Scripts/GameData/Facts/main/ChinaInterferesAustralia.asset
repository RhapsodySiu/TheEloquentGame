  description: "Australia is the canary in the coal mine of Chinese Communist Party
    interference. Over the past 18 months, the country has been shaken by allegations
    of the Chinese party-state working to covertly manipulate the Australian political
    system and curate the wider political landscape. There are claims of Beijing-linked
    political donors buying access and influence, universities being co-opted as \u201Cpropaganda
    vehicles,\u201D and Australian-funded scientific research being diverted to aid
    the modernization of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA). Most notoriously,
    an ambitious young senator, Sam Dastyari, was exposed for parroting Communist
    Party talking points and giving countersurveillance advice to a Chinese political
    donor before being hounded into premature retirement.\n\nhttps://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-03-09/how-china-interferes-australia\n"
