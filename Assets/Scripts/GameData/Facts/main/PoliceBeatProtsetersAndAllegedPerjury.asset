  description: "Hong Kong police are under fire with claims officers arrested a protester
    under false pretenses \u2013 by putting a large rod into his backpack after he
    was apprehended during the clearout of a street protest in Causeway Bay on Sunday.
    Police have denied wrongdoing, but footage of the incident \u2013 captured by
    local broadcaster nowTV \u2013 shows police officers apparently planting the rod
    in the arrested man backpack while he was being held. The father of the arrested
    man told Asia Times that his son is still being detained by police. His mother
    posted on Facebook a claim that police allegedly beat her son \u2013 causing him
    to suffer a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nhttps://www.asiatimes.com/2019/08/article/hk-police-deny-framing-beating-protester/"
