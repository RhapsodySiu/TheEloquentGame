  description: 'Even though the Basic Law grants Hong Kong residents the rights to
    freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, the HKPF could impose undue restrictions
    using their statutory powers. Since police officers enjoy extensive statutory
    powers while performing their duties, it is not hard to conclude that when police
    officers are suspected of abusing their powers or breaching the law while on duty,
    there would hardly be any accessible channel for citizens to seek redress under
    existing law. The problem would only be aggravated if the HKPF and high-ranking
    officials continue to ignore the issue or even commend the police for their transgressions.
