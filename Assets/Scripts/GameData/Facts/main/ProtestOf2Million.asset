  description: "Nearly 2 million protesters flooded the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday,
    organisers claimed, delivering a stunning repudiation of Chief Executive Carrie
    Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor\u2019s governance and forcing a public apology out of the
    city\u2019s leader over her campaign to bulldoze a controversial extradition bill
    through the legislature. A day after Lam suspended her push for the bill, expecting
    it to defuse a crisis that has seen violent clashes between mostly young protesters
    and police, the centre of Hong Kong was brought to a complete standstill as the
    masses marched to chastise her for refusing to withdraw the bill or apologise
    when first asked to, and declaring that nothing short of her resignation would
    satisfy them now.\n\nhttps://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3014737/nearly-2-million-people-take-streets-forcing-public-apology"
